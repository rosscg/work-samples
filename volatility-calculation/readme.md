# Stock Volatility Calculation


**Given files containing price data for 4 stocks, calculate volatility over the period as a percentage annualised volatility of returns.**

- Like most real data, there are biases and error in the input which require correcting.

- Results need to be ready before the market opens and therefore the code should be considered to run automatically and unsupervised as part of a scheduled set of tasks.

- Input comprises 4 csv files in which each row represents a trade, with columns providing the trade time and price.

--- 

This code constitutes a submission for a 4-hour assignment from a quant trading firm, defined above.

The submission included the files:
- main.py -- representing the pipeline code
- notebook.ipynb -- notebook file showing more complete analysis code and discussion
- report.pdf -- discussion of approach (not included here, but largely repeated in notebook)
