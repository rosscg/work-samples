# Stock Volatility Calculation

[**View Primary File**](notebook.ipynb)

---

**Given files containing price data for 4 stocks, calculate volatility over the period as a percentage annualised volatility of returns.**

- Like most real data, there are biases and error in the input which require correcting.

- Results need to be ready before the market opens and therefore the code should be considered to run automatically and unsupervised as part of a scheduled set of tasks.

- Input comprises 4 csv files in which each row represents a trade, with columns providing the trade time and price.

--- 

This code constitutes a submission for a 4-hour assignment from a quant trading firm, defined above.

The submission included the files:
- [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb) -- notebook file showing the complete analysis code and discussion/
- [main.py](main.py) -- representing the final pipeline code.
- [report.pdf](report/report.pdf) -- brief discussion of approach (a more complete discussion is provided in the notebook).
